Here are the important and basic points to know about the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code of your typing speed test project:

1. Basic Structure

- HTML Layout:
  - The structure includes a div for the typing test UI with a heading, a placeholder for the sentence, an input field for typing, and a button to start/stop the game.

- CSS Styling:
  - Styles are applied to create a modern, clean UI using Google Fonts, a background image, and a glassmorphism effect on the typing test container (.child div).
  - The button has a gradient background and hover effects for interactivity.

2. Core Functionality (JavaScript)

- Random Sentence Selection: 
  - The getrandom() function selects a random sentence from an array (data1) to display for the user to type.

- Start and End of the Game:
  - playgame(): Starts the game by enabling the input field, showing a random sentence, and storing the start time.
  - endgame(): Ends the game, captures the end time, calculates typing speed (WPM), and checks for incorrectly typed words.

3. Key Calculations and Comparisons

- Typing Speed (Words Per Minute):
  - calculateSpeed(start, end, wordCount): Calculates the userâ€™s typing speed by dividing the number of words typed by the time taken and converting it to WPM.

- Error Checking:
  - checkIncorrectWords(typedWords): Compares the user-typed words with the original sentence, counting how many words were mistyped or incorrect.

 4. DOM Manipulation

- Dynamic UI Updates:
  - The text inside the button and the question changes dynamically based on whether the user is starting or finishing the game.
  - The input field is enabled/disabled during different stages of the game.

 5. Event Handling

- Button Event Listener:
  - Detects whether the button says "Start" or "Done."
  - Runs the appropriate function (playgame() to start or endgame() to finish) based on the current state.

 Key Points to Remember:

- Sentence Randomization: The game randomly selects a sentence for each round, ensuring a different challenge each time.
- Typing Speed Calculation: The test calculates typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) using the time taken and the number of words typed.
- Error Detection: It checks for incorrectly typed words and reports the number of errors in the result.
- Start/Stop Mechanism: The button toggles between "Start" and "Done," allowing the user to control the test's flow.
- Simple Input Validation: The script ensures that the user has typed enough characters before allowing the test to end.

By focusing on these points, you get a good grasp of how the project works and its essential features!
